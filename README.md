This code implements a Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm to train an agent to play the game of Snake. It imports necessary libraries and modules, defines a class called DQN, and a function called train_dqn. 

The DQN class represents the agent and contains methods for building and compiling the model, storing experiences in memory, selecting actions, and replaying experiences to train the model. The agent's model is a sequential neural network with dense layers. The replay method uses a minibatch of experiences to update the model's weights based on the Bellman equation. The agent gradually reduces exploration (epsilon) over time to favor exploitation.

The train_dqn function initializes the agent, loops through a specified number of episodes, resets the game environment, selects actions, stores experiences, and performs model training. At the end of each episode, it prints the final state and score. The function returns the list of cumulative rewards for each episode.

In the main function, the parameters for the DQN algorithm are set, an instance of the Snake game environment is created, and the train_dqn function is called to train the agent for a certain number of episodes. The results are stored in a dictionary and then plotted using the pd.plot_result method.

Overall, this code trains an agent to play Snake using the DQN algorithm and provides a way to visualize the training results.
